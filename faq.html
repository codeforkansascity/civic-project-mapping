                                WHAT IS CONSIDERED A ‘COMMUNITY PROJECT?’

                            <p>For the purposes of the CommunityKC online map, a community project is one that builds
                                the capacity,
                                skills, resources, and leadership of organizations so they can better address challenges
                                they face and
                                effectively take advantage of opportunities and assets. </p>

                            <p>CommunityKC focuses more on projects with a physical location, rather than general
                                programs or single
                                events. We realize, though, that the line between project, program, and event can be
                                hard to define and
                                have kept the exact definition of ‘community project’ somewhat open so as not to exclude
                                something that
                                has a positive impact in the community. We have also added a ‘Resource’ tab to capture
                                information about
                                valuable programs that don’t fit squarely within the definition of a community project.
                                The project
                                information form includes a few preliminary questions to help determine whether a
                                project is a good fit
                                for this map. </p>

                                The map uses a Google Maps platform. You can filter projects based on project type so

                                you are interested in are visible on the map. You can also navigate to specific areas of
                                the map to find
                                projects there.</p>
