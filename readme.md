### Problem Statement

Need for a community project map: *The Community Capital Fund* and our partners have realized through our 
work that a map of existing community-based projects does not exist and that often, neighborhood associations 
and organizations are not aware of projects/programs occurring near them, and often do not know of other 
organizations doing similar work. CCF believes that neighborhoods that partner with and learn from others 
doing similar work will have greater capacity, opportunities, and resources to carry out their work; will have a 
greater impact on community development and revitalization than when working in a silo; and will have a more 
sustained, long-term impact.
